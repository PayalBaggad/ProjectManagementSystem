Task [Day 1]
Que 1: What is the difference between async and sync, which server file we'll use in those cases for Django?
Ans : In synchronous (sync) tasks, processes are handled one after the other, blocking others until one finishes, while in asynchronous (async) tasks, multiple processes run simultaneously without waiting. In Django, for sync tasks, the default **WSGI** server is used, while for async tasks, you would use **ASGI** server.
